<h3>Deconstructed lasagna Recipe</h3>
    <p>This delicous healthy meal is my week night go to! It's easy to make, and cusotmizable for any pallet.</p>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
            <ul>
                <li> Ground Chicken</li>
                <li> Any pasta you like, I usually use what I have left on hand. You can also use broken up lasagna noodles!</li>
                <li> Tomato pastes</li>
                <li> Chicken broth</li>
                <li> Spinach</li>
                <li> Ricotta</li>
                <li> Cherry tomatoes</li>
                <li> Garlic</li>
                <li> Italian seasoning</li>
                <li> Red chili flakes</li>

        <h5>Steps</h5>
            <ol>
                <li> Slice cherry tomoatoes in half and get them roasting with olive oil and some salt and pepper.</li>
                <li> Bring salted water to a boil for your chosen pasta.</li>
                <li> Start browning your ground chicken, season to taste.</li>
                <li> Once your chicken is cooked through, drain any excess oil and mix in your tomato paste, garlic, italian seasonings, lots of red chili flakes and chicken broth. How much you add is completely up to you! If you want it to be more of a soup, add a lot! If you like a 'true' lasagna add a little.</li>
                <li> Add your cooked pasta and a little bit of the pasta water to your ground chicken sauce.</li>
                <li> I add in my spinach last to wilt while the heat is off.</li>
                <li> Place your pasta dish into whatever bowl makes you feel like your an italian grandma!</li>
                <li> Top with ricotta, your rosted tomatoes! You can always add anything you may have on hand, like grated parmasean!</li>
            </ol>
