    <h3>Matcha Recipe</h3>
        <p>This is my favorite way to start the day!</p>
            <h5>Ingredients</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li> Quality matcha powder, I personally like Chamberlain coffee's vanilla matcha.</li>
                    <li> A vanilla protein powder</li>
                    <li> Any milk you'd like, I personally use oat milk.</li>
                    <li> I also top mine with whipped cream when I have it on hand!</li>
                </ul>

            <h5>Steps</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li> First, you want to whisk your matcha powder with some water. This is especially important if you are using a dairy based milk as the proteins in dairy attach themselves to the matcha and block them from being absorbed by your body. This reduces all the healthy benefits you get by drinking matcha.</li>
                    <li> I then mix my milk and protein powder in a blender bottle, this just prevents any lumps of protein powder.</li>
                    <li> Pick a cute glass, fill it with ice, add your matcha and top it off with your protein milk!</li>
                    <li> You can add some much to this simple mix!</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Want even more of a caffeine kick? Add chai tea!</li>
                            <li> Want some sweetness? Add a syrup! There's so many flavors to choose from!</li>
                            <li> Add some boba!</li>
                            <li> Adorn it with a homemade strawberry cold foam! (my personal favorite!)</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
