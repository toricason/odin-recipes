<h3>Salmon Bowl Recipe</h3>
    <p>This delicous healthy meal is my week night go to! It's easy to make, and cusotmizable for any pallet.</p>
        <h5>Bowl Ingredients</h5>
            <ul>
                <li> Salmon - I personally marinate my salmon in toasted sesame oil, siracha, soy sauce and garlic.</li>
                <li> Jasmine rice</li>
                <li> Any vegetables you'd like</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Sauce Ingredients</h5>   
            <ul>
                <li> Japenese Mayo</li>
                <li> Sesame oil</li>
                <li> Lime juice</li>
                <li> Siracha</li>
                <li> Hoisin sauce</li>
                <li> Soy sauce</li>
                <li> Grated garlic</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Steps</h5>
            <ol>
                <li> Cube fresh Salmon into one inch cubes.</li>
                <li> Mix together sesame oil, siracha, soy sauce and garlic in a medium mixing bowl and add your salmon.</li>
                <li> While your salmon is marinating, bring water to a boil for your rice.</li>
                <li> Trim chosen vegatables as needed, toss them in your favorite cooking oil and season how you like, place in the oven to roast.</li>
                <li> In a large skillet, place on medium heat and add sesame oil once the pan is warm. Sesame oil has a low smoke point, so make sure it doesn't get too hot.</li>
                <li> Once oil is hot, add your salmon cubes in a single layer. Don't touch them until its time to flip, in about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li> While your salmon is cooking, make your sauce! Simply combine the above ingredients together to taste. The sauce should be a creamy oragne color.</li>
                <li> Place your rice at the bottom of a large bowl, arrange your chosen vegatables and your crispy salmon and drizzle your sauce on top! If you'd like you can always add sesame seeds, green onion, or even avocado on top!</li>
            </ol>
